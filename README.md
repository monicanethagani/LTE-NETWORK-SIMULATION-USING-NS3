# LTE-NETWORK-SIMULATION-USING-NS3
NS-3 simulator is an open source software publicly available under the GNU GPLv2 license for R&D uses.
It is used for simulating network topologies. 
The goal of ns-3 simulator is to develop a preferred, open simulation environment for networking research. 
NS-3 can run C++ and Python scripts.

This project has worked towards designing a network topology that contains 3 antenna nodes and 4 user nodes. 
In the designed topology, there are 3 stationary users and one user which moves from one end to another end. 
During this process, there will be two handovers being done. 
When the moving user comes closer to one of the antennas, the user will get disconnected from the connected antenna and gets handed over to the nearest antenna. 
In this project, the user gets handed over two times.
